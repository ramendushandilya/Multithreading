Below are the Thread Life Cycles

+ New
    : When we instantiate a thread it's in the new state until we call the start() method to start it.

+ Runnable
    : After we start the thread, it's in the runnable state. The thread is executing it's task in this
      state.

+ Running
    : When the thread is in this state it's doing its task.

+ Waiting
    : When a thread is waiting for another thread for example to finish its task, it's in the waiting state.

+ Dead
    : When the thread completes its task it goes into this state. When a thread is dead, it's simply dead
      it can't do anything now.
